## RDRPOSTagger ##

__This is a Python 3 porting of RDRPOSTagger, the original for Python 2 is [here](https://github.com/datquocnguyen/RDRPOSTagger)__

## Note: if you are looking for a FOSS POS tagger for Python 3, have a look at [Spacy](https://spacy.io/)  

**RDRPOSTagger** is a robust, easy-to-use and language-independent toolkit for POS and morphological tagging. It employs an error-driven approach to automatically construct tagging rules in the form of a binary tree. The main properties of RDRPOSTagger are as follows:

- RDRPOSTagger obtains very fast performance in both learning and tagging process.

- RDRPOSTagger achieves a very competitive accuracy in comparison to the state-of-the-art results. See experimental results including performance speed and tagging accuracy for 13 languages in our *AI Communications* article.

- RDRPOSTagger supports the pre-trained POS and morphological tagging models for Bulgarian, Czech, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish, Thai and Vietnamese.  Additionally, RDRPOSTagger supports the pre-trained Universal POS tagging models for 40 languages.

The general architecture and experimental results of RDRPOSTagger can be found in our following papers:
