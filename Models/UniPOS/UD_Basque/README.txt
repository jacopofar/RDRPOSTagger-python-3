Introduction

The Basque UD treebank is based on a conversion from part of the Basque Dependency Treebank (BDT), created at the University of of the Basque Country by the IXA NLP research group. The treebank consists of 5274 sentences (60563 tokens) and covers mainly literary and journalistic texts.

Sentences were randomized and divided in 60-20-20 splits for the train, dev and test files, repectively.

* CHANGELOG 1.1 -> 1.2

- The size increased since v1.1 after adding a new set of sentences from BDT which include previously non-treated phenomena like multiwords, entities and complex post-positions
- Some errors in POS have been fixed (related to some SCONJ that were in fact Verbs)
